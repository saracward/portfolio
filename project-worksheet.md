# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

| Day   | Deliverable                                  | Status     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Day 1 | Project Description                          | Incomplete |
| Day 1 | Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline      | Incomplete |
| Day 3 | Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete |
| Day 4 | MVP & Bug Fixes                              | Incomplete |
| Day 5 | Final Touches                                | Incomplete |
| Day 6 | Present                                      | Incomplete |

## Project Description

I would like to make a really creative website. As we learn how to create more effects, I would eventually like for my page to look similar to [this one][1]. But for my first attempt I would like to mimic [this page][2]. I realize neither of these are going to be easy, but I really am excited to start making things for ourselves that we can present to other people.

## Google Sheet

Here is a link to where all my projects [live](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SQUgF64A0yENOhR_s8hI8riW43xDlaVuJhzBbZh7HVw/edit#gid=0)

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix

N - navigation
P - Project links
M - Mouse over
I - Background Image
G - Grid
R - Responsive

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP (examples)

- Pull data from google sheets
- Render data on page adding mouse overs
- Navigation bar
- Main landing page image as background

#### PostMVP

- Adding a welcome message on top of background image
- project name appears on top of project image when moused over
- email link
- social media links

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP

| Component           | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Navigation          |    H     |     1.5hr      |     hr      |
| Project links       |    H     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Creating mouse over |    H     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Image background    |    H     |      1hr       |     hr      |
| Grid and others     |    H     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Responsive          |    H     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Total               |    H     |    14.5 hrs    |     hrs     |

#### PostMVP

| Component          | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |

## Additional Libraries

Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
