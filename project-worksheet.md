# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

| Day   | Deliverable                                  | Status     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Day 1 | Project Description                          | Incomplete |
| Day 1 | Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline      | Incomplete |
| Day 3 | Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete |
| Day 4 | MVP & Bug Fixes                              | Incomplete |
| Day 5 | Final Touches                                | Incomplete |
| Day 6 | Present                                      | Incomplete |

## Project Description

I would like to make a really creative website. As we learn how to create more effects, I would eventually like for my page to look similar to [this one][1]. But for my first attempt I would like to mimic [this page][2]. I realize neither of these are going to be easy, but I really am excited to start making things for ourselves that we can present to other people.

## Google Sheet

Here is a link to where all my projects [live](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SQUgF64A0yENOhR_s8hI8riW43xDlaVuJhzBbZh7HVw/edit#gid=0)

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix

[Link](https://res.cloudinary.com/jkeohan/image/upload/a_270/v1591621734/project1_matrix_ocy5gc_h1kg0m.jpg)

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix. This involves drawing a a square. In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line. The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs. This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete.

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis. The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`. This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features. Continue to assign each feature a letter. Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter.

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP (examples)

- Pull data from google sheets
- Render data on page adding mouse overs
- Navigation bar
- Main landing page image as background

#### PostMVP

- Adding a welcome message on top of background image
- project name appears on top of project image when moused over
- email link
- social media links

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP

| Component           | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Navigation          |    H     |     1.5hr      |     hr      |
| Project links       |    H     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Creating mouse over |    H     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Image background    |    H     |      1hr       |     hr      |
| Grid and others     |    H     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Responsive          |    H     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Total               |    H     |    14.5 hrs    |     hrs     |

#### PostMVP

| Component          | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| ------------------ | :------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Social Media Icons |    L     |      3hr       |     hr      |
| Email link         |    L     |      1hr       |     hr      |
| Welcome text       |    L     |      2hr       |     hr      |
| Make own icon      |    L     |      4hr       |     hr      |
| Total              |    H     |    24.5hrs     |     hrs     |
